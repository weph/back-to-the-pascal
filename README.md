# Back to the Pascal

Back to the Pascal is a little project of mine, where I'm trying to build a game in Turbo Pascal on a 386DX-40.
I'm documenting my progress in a [weekly video series on YouTube][Playlist] and sharing the code here on GitHub so
people can follow along, or maybe even use it as a starting point for their own game somwhere down the line.

If you wanna learn more about the backstory and why I'm doing this, check out this video:
